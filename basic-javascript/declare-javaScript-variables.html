        // Understanding Uninitialized Variables 
        
        // ^ When JavaScript variables are declared, they have an initial value of undefined. If you do a mathematical operation on an undefined variable your result will be NaN which means "Not a Number". If you concatenate a string with an undefined variable, you will get a literal string of "undefined".
        
        // Understanding Case Sensitivity in Variables
        // ^ Write variable names in JavaScript in camelCase. In camelCase, multi-word variable names have the first word in lowercase and the first letter of each subsequent word is capitalized.

        // Add Two Numbers with JavaScript [+ addition]

        // Subtract One Number from Another with JavaScript [- subtract]

        // Multiply Two Numbers with JavaScript [* multiply]

        // Divide One Number by Another with JavaScript [/ divided]

        // Increment a Number with JavaScript [++ increment number]

        // Decrement a Number with JavaScript [-- decrement]

        // Create Decimal Numbers with JavaScript [0.0] and multiply [0.0 * 0.0]

        // Divide One Decimal by Another with JavaScript [0.0 / 0.0]

        // Finding a Remainder in JavaScript [% modulus] 

        // Compound Assignment With Augmented Addition [+=]

        // Compound Assignment With Augmented Subtraction [-=]

        // Compound Assignment With Augmented Multiplication [*=]

        // Compound Assignment With Augmented Division [/=]
